The first and most important step in creating Fireboy and Watergirl is gravity and movement
Imported gravity from the orb classwork, and reorganized class names/functionality
Started 'w', 'a', and 'd' movements for fireboy, UP, LEFT, and RIGHT movements for watergirl via keypressed in the Game class
Moved a lot of the movement mechanics into the Character class as opposed to keeping it in Game, but setup remains in the Game class
Movement horizontally working
Started working with gravity, working oddly
